## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Greenhouse Gases' Pollutants
- `EDA.ipynb`

Performed EDA on the OECD Dataset. Computed a correlation heatmap to determine the pollutants most responsible for causing climate related hazards (wildfires, wind, floods, droughts). 

## Data Analysis of Climate Related Hazards per Country
- `climate-related-hazards.ipynb`

Performed EDA on the OECD Dataset. Conducted time series analysis on climate related hazards (wildfires, wind, floods, droughts) over 19 years (2001-2020) for different OECD member countries.

## Focus on Netherlands Data
- `netherlands-data-analysis.ipynb`

Focus on Netherlands' greenhouse gases data. Performed time series analysis of pollutants of the city of Maastricht and the whole Netherlands. 

## Biodiversity Data Analysis
- `biodiversity.ipynb`

Performed EDA on the OECD Dataset. Computed a correlation heatmap to determine a connection between endangered species of animals and the pollutants over the 19 years (2001-2020).
